Omega Mage Final Project by Xavier Martinez

Omega Mage completed via book instructions.
All spells implemented in some way (unfortunately no target Spells, only "Ground Spells" since I couldn't figure it out in time...)

Spell list:
Fire = damage (doesn't affect spikers nor mage as per instructions)
Water = Slows Bug Enemies. (Effects are permanent unless the room is re-entered)
Earth = Slows Spiker Enemies. (Effects are permanent unless the room is re-entered)
Air = Temporary Self Speed Boost. (Multiple pass-throughs = more speed until effect wears off)
